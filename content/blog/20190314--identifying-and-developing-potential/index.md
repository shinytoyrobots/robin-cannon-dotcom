title: Identifying and Developing Potential
description: One of the most rewarding parts of my job is helping people fulfil their potential. It's great for me to see new or undiscovered talent do great things for my team. It's also great to see those people grow, even if it means they move on to other things.

It's great to meet and interview high-quality, seasoned developers. But a big part of me prefers the hiring process for positions that need less experience. There's real excitement in meeting a new developer and thinking about how great they can be. Or talking to someone who hasn't found the right spot for their potential before, and realizing I might be able to provide that opportunity.

I think I'm good at identifying potential, and nurturing it. Taking only my four years at IBM, people I've hired, or managed in their first year of employment, have progressed rapidly. Some are development leads at IBM. Or they might be a Senior UI Engineer at Netflix. Or driving Gatsby's Cloud Services development effort. Of course, much of that is due to their own talent and drive. But one of the most important things I can do as a manager is provide guidance and opportunity for talent to grow.
